[00:21.52] My love, will you
[00:27.17] Take my hand with virtue?
[00:32.96] For time has proved
[00:38.34] That I, do love you
[00:47.84] 
[00:44.46] Will we ever find
[00:49.21] A way to make our time last forever?
[00:56.76] Because I begin to miss you
[01:10.26] 
[01:26.98] One kiss from you
[01:32.26] And your touch will change
[01:37.85] My life and my blue
[01:43.23] As long as you stay
[01:52.73] 
[01:48.04] Will we ever find
[01:53.70] A way to make our time last forever?
[02:02.08] Because I begin to miss you
[02:15.58] 
[02:09.65] Will we ever find
[02:15.70] A way to make our time last forever?
[02:23.93] Because I begin to miss you
[02:37.43] 
[02:31.48] Will we ever find
[02:37.12] A way to make our time last forever?
[02:45.86] Because I begin to miss you
